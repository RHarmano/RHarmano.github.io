                <p>
                    I attend Queen's University as an Engineering Physics student in the mechanical option.<br><br>
                    For the past few years I have been working on to create mechatronic and robotic systems, 
                    starting with a rover on the Queen's Space Engineering team and moving on to a hydrogen vehicle on the Queen's Fuel Cell Team where I spent a year as an electrical manager. 
                    During this time, I worked for a summer at IMAX to devlop software for the alignment of components in an optical relay and perform validation on existing manufacturing systems.<br><br>
                    My time on both teams has granted me oportunities to learn about a wide variety of practical engineering skills such as PCB and CAD design, software engineering, computational physics and data science.
